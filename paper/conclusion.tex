\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

HTTP provides little security for users, and is susceptible to man in the middle attacks.  We presented Multisurf, a system for detecting and notifying a user of a potentially malicious website.  Multisurf is a Chrome browser extension that allows for easy access and usability.  

Using the Alexa Top 100 sites, we have shown that Multisurf can use a variety of comparison algorithms to detect differences in web page responses.  This shows that our system can detect an active man in the middle attack, where the attacker is carrying out a targeted attack on the client.  Multisurf does this in a user-friendly way and without presenting obstacle to the user.
